# Mint feed - a little app by Jesse

We're building an app that displays a feed of mints of ERC1155s and then let's you mint them.

Our basic plan is:

1. Get a single NFT rendering
2. Get all of the items in the 1155 rendering in a feed
3. Get minting working
4. Upgrade minting to use Session Keys
